/*This was another huge roadblock for me so what I would think I would have to do in this situation 
would be to set up a form valdation and a boorlan to check to see if the
coupons were valid or not. So for example, if a coupon was expired the boorlan
would come up with the statement of false. If the coupon was valid or working
this the boolan would come up with the statement of true. You would also
use the Date.now() comand in Javascript in order for it to check today's current date
to compare to the expire date that is on the coupon. If today's date
was past the date that was on the coupon then the boonlan would come
up with a statement of false. If else, the boolan would come with a statement
of true which in turn would allow use of the coupon. Also, to check
whether a given email input is valid I would say that would again be
a check form function in javascript that would be looking for elements
and if it is not met to the standards set then boolan would return the result of
false and if standards were met for the email the boonlan would come up with a statement
of true. That would be my logical understanding on how I would think the problem
would have to be solved.*/
